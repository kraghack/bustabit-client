          <p>You will need to transfer bitcoins to the deposit address on your account page. If you do not have any bitcoins, we can recommend
            <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coinbase</a> if you are in the US (although the registration process is lengthy).
            Another great option is <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LocalBitcoins.com</a>, which lists traders
						in your area willing to sell (or buy) bitcoins. You can also search online to see if there are any bitcoin ATMs near you.
						And remember, you can withdraw directly to the bitcoin address on your deposit page!</p>
